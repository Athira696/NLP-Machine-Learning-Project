# NLP-Machine-Learning-Project
This project develops a machine learning model to classify text from mental health forums and social media into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) and detect emotions like anxiety, depression, and happiness. It aims to help professionals track emotional shifts and identify signs of distress.
